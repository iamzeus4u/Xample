    <string name="hymn1">Leadership is a very crucial aspect of any endeavour involving
        more than one individual especially if such endeavour is to succeed.
        Most leadership skill can be acquired however a natural leader should
        have some basic or inherent qualities in them even if they are not aware of it.
        I am a natural leader and these are some of those qualities. \n\n\n
The ability to care about the welfare of others is not
        just a leadership quality it is a core human value.
        The aptitude to understand the need of the people around you and
        provide it even before they ask. As students we were not taught how to
        use structural design applications such as SAP2000, CSC Orion etc.
        but I learnt them on my own. During my industrial training I
        discovered most engineering companies where using these a
        pplications and designed manually just for checks,
        I organised my classmates and later on other classes and taught them some of these applications, it actually helped some students improve in class, I went on to teach two of my lecturers.
